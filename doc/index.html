This is a small tool with which you can see what's inside a SpaceChem savegame. You can also use it to import and export solutions, and clear the undo list, which is actually the brunt of the file.<br><br>

It's still somewhat early days for the tool and it lacks polish, but it can already do some useful stuff.

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <div class="content">
<ul>
  <li><b>Windows XP or higher</b> (sorry)</li>
  <li><b>.NET 4.0</b>. You probably have this already. If not, you can download it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li><b>System.Data.SQLite.dll</b> (included)</li>

<p>
The basic use of the tool should be obvious. It starts with opening a savegame. These are the 
<tt>.user</tt> files that can be found in
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Windows XP</b>: C:/Documents and Settings/<i>&lt;username&gt;</i>/Local Settings/Application Data/Zachtronics Industries/SpaceChem/save</li>
  <li><b>Windows 7 / Vista</b>: C:/Users/<i>&lt;username&gt;</i>/AppData/Local/Zachtronics Industries/SpaceChem/save</li>
  <li><b>OSX / Linux</b>: ~/.local/share/Zachtronics Industries/SpaceChem</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<div class="note">
  <h4>Note : SaveChem does not automatically create backups</h4>
  <p>
  All actions performed in the tool are performed directly on the savegame. If an action deletes 
  or adds things, it will affect the savegame immediately. 
  </p>
</div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="ssec-usage-features" class="ssec">
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <div class="content">

<h4>Export (to clipboard)</h4>
<p>
<kbd>Export</kbd> allows you to export the solution for the current level. For the moment, 
it's only export-to-clipboard, but it shouldn't be too hard to add export-to-file as well.
<span class="mini">(It's just boring to do so)</span>
</p><br>

<p>
Select a level and click <kbd>Export to clipboard</kbd> to export a solution description to 
the clipboard.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Slice</h4>
<p>
With this, you can create a 'slice' of the levels in the savegame. Effectively, this creates a savegame with only the selected solutions in it. This <i>dramatically</i> reduces the filesize, making it perfect for uploading only a few levels to solutionNet, or just to keep as a small backup.
</p>

      <b>Slicing</b>. Select multiple levels and hit <kbd>Slice</kbd> to create a savegame with just the selected levels.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
<h4>Import Level</h4>
<p>
Import a custom level, as you would inside the game. This makes it easier to import a solution 
of a mission you don't have yet.
</p><br>
<p>
I will say, however, that the validator won't accept everything yet. If you try to import 
something that you know is a valid level, but isn't accepted, send it to me and I'll see what 
I can do. At present, it doesn't accept sandbox missions yet.
</p>

<div class="ibox center">
  <div class="frame">
    <img src="img/import-level-full.png" alt="">
    <div class="caption">
      <b>Import level</b>. Enter the level definition at the top and hit <kbd>Parse</kbd>. 
      If that succeeds, you can import the level via <kbd>OK</kbd>.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
<h4>Import Solution</h4>
<p>
This is the big one. This can import a previously exported solution to your savegame. This 
<i>will</i>, of course, delete all traces of the old solution, so be sure you're actually 
importing what you want.
</p><br>
<p>
The way it works is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Choose your import source</b>. For now it's just text-input, but files will be added in due time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Parse the solution</b>. This will parse the solution input and see if it is a proper 
    solution. If so it will show some of the solution's statistics and determine level 
    candidates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="ibox right">
      <div class="frame" style="width:296px">
        <img src="img/import-solution-candidates.png" alt="">
        <div class="caption">
          <b>Level candidates</b>. A list of levels that this solution could be for. Here, they're 
          all called 'Sun Simulator', which is why renaming can be useful -_-.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <b>Candidates and level select</b>. The parsing step also tries to find 'candidate' levels that  this solution belongs to. It does so according to 3 criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>internal level ID (<b>i</b>)
      <li>level definition (<b>d</b>)
      <li>level name (<b>n</b>)
    </ul>
    The solutions are put in the drop-down on the right, sorted by these criteria. It will also display the last score for those levels. For official levels, there should be only one; for custom missions, there may be more. It's possible that no level can be found that matches the solution. In that case, you probably haven't played that level yet.<br>
    In any case, select the level that you want to import the solution for.
    

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Additional custom options</b>. For custom missions, there are some extra options. You can choose to create a <kbd>copy</kbd> of the mission so that the original solution is spared. If you choose to copy, you can also give the level a different name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Click OK!</b>. You're done! You can import! Woo \o/
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="ibox center">
  <div class="frame" style="width:640px;">
    <img src="img/import-solution-full.png" alt="">
    <div class="caption">
      <b>Import solution</b>. Enter the level definition at the top and hit <kbd>Parse</kbd>. 
      If that succeeds, you'll get a solution summary in the bottom-left, and a candidate list 
      on the right. Pick the desired candidate, maybe set a new name, and click <kbd>OK</kbd> to 
      import.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
<h4>Clear undo</h4>
<p>
The savegames keep an infinite undo history. This means that if you've been playing for a while, 
the savegame is mostly undo information, maybe even up to 90%. The <kbd>Clear Undo</kbd> allows 
you to remove that. 
</p><br>
<p>
Select one or more levels, then hit <kbd>Clear Undo</kbd> to remove the the undo information 
for those levels.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>    
I make no guarantees on whether or not this will screw up the savegame. I've tested the core functionalities and they <i>should</i> work, but I can't be held responsible if the savegame becomes 
corrupt. At present, I'd still suggest creating a backup before you start importing things.

I'd also like to know just how big some people's UndoCount has become. My record is 8000, and I already know someone got to 23k.
